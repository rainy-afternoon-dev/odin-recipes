Hi there curious one!

This is simple recipe website for Odin Project practice! HTML pro here I come!

Goals:
- simple index with links to recipes
- recipe pages with a picture, ingredients and instructions in both ul and ol formats

Achieved:
- basic html boilerplate building
- linking with both relative and absolute links!
- pay attention to typos: hi is not the same as h1
- practise on git add, commit and push
